						</header>
						<p>
							Welcome to the workshop on trustworthy foundation models 2024! This is an academic research event dedicated to exploring the transformative impact of these models on society, life, and research. 
							As foundation models continue to integrate into various aspects of our daily lives, numerous trust issues have emerged, including but limited to concerns related to privacy, security, fairness, explainability, hallucination, bias, etc. 
							This workshop aims to foster a collaborative environment by inviting esteemed researchers from both academia and industry to discuss the latest developments and ongoing challenges in creating trustworthy foundation models.

      Trustworthy Computer Vision Models
</h4>
    <p>
      <b>Abstract</b>: Computer vision tasks range from the simple perspective projection matrix estimation in a traditional camera calibration application to the large-scale foundation model fitting in a contemporary object detection cloud service. One may solve most computer vision tasks through fitting functions mapping the dense, if not continuous due to quantization, visual input to a discrete and meaningful output space, including categories, bounding boxes, and depths. Due to the significant difference in cardinalities of the domain and codomain, these mapping functions fail to meet one of the three Hadamard criteria for being well-posed. In other words, the unstable computer vision solution does not depend continuously on the parameters or input data. Many researchers are trying their best to design or learn computer vision algorithms being sufficiently robust to complex perturbations such as occlusion, smoke, rain, and fog. There are also scholars looking for dedicated but powerful adversarial perturbations. Does there exist an invariant backdoor perturbation that is capable to push an arbitrary image across the decision boundary in a classification task? Are all perturbations adversarial? Why do the AI models succeed? Fail? In this talk, I will introduce these questions our team is exploring and briefly outline some of the progress. However, much remains unclear in spite of our efforts, and we reiterate that there might not have the answers we're looking for before AI undergoes a brand-new paradigm shift.</p>

</h4>

  </p>
  <div class="square">
    <p>
      <b>Abstract</b>: This talk will introduce NEC cotomi generative AI services with the development of "NEC cotomi Pro" and "NEC cotomi Light," two new high-speed generative AI Large Language Models (LLM) featuring updated training data and architectures. NEC’s newly developed NEC cotomi Pro and NEC cotomi Light are high-speed, high-performance models that deliver the same high performance as global LLMs, but at more than ten times the speed.</p>

    <p>
      <b>Abstract</b>: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities and are widely used in various applications. Ensuring the safe operation of LLMs is crucial. In this talk, we will discuss several safety risks associated with LLMs, such as jailbreak attacks and indirect prompt injection attacks, and introduce the research efforts aimed at defending against these risks.
   <br>
      <b>Biography</b>: Dr. Fangzhao Wu is now a researcher at Social Computing group, Microsoft Research Asia. His research mainly focuses on responsible AI, especially the safety, privacy, copyright, and social impact of LLMs.</p>

    Distributed LLM Learning Systems: from Data Centers to the Edge
</h4>

    <p>
      <b>Abstract</b>: The recent success of machine learning, especially deep learning, stems from the availability of big data and strong computational power brought by cutting-edge hardware (e.g., GPUs and TPUs). Facing massive computational loads, it is inefficient or sometimes impossible to train models on a single machine, driving attention towards distributed machine learning on multiple machines. This talk reviews the recent research efforts about distributed systems for machine learning. It starts from data centers, and present concepts and motivations of distributed machine learning, paying special attention on machine learning job scheduling on heterogeneous GPUs. Then, it walks out of data centers to show how to extend the distributed machine learning ideas to edge devices. Finally, it presents new challenges of training distributed unstructured data, graphs, and possible solutions. </p>

    Challenges in Privacy and Security of Generative AI Models
</h4>
    <p>
      <b>Abstract</b>: Large models have demonstrated unprecedented success in many applications in the past few years. Meanwhile, the research advancement of foundation models is accompanied by a surge of attention to its privacy and security implications. The pursuit of this research direction is for theoretical interest, but is in fact a pressing need as several real life attacks on commercialized products have been successfully demonstrated. In this talk, I will give an overview of the major challenges in deploying large models in a privacy-preserving and security-respecting manner. We will also discuss how privacy-enhancing technologies could help in mitigating these emerging challenges.</p>
